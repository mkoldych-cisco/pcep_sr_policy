    PCEP extension to support Segment Routing Policy Candidate Paths
              draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp-09

Abstract

   A Segment Routing (SR) Policy ([RFC9256]) is a non-empty set of SR
   Candidate Paths, that all share the same <headend, color, endpoint>
   tuple.  This document extends [RFC8664] to fully support the SR
   Policy construct.  SR Policy is modeled in PCEP as an Association of
   one or more SR Candidate Paths.  PCEP extensions are defined to
   signal additional attributes of an SR Policy, which are not covered
   by [RFC8664].  The mechanism is applicable to all data planes of SR
   (MPLS, SRv6, etc.).

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

1.  Introduction

   Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)
   [RFC5440] enables the communication between a Path Computation Client
   (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs based
   on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   PCEP Extensions for the Stateful PCE Model [RFC8231] describes a set
   of extensions to PCEP to enable active control of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   tunnels.  [RFC8281] describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated
   LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for dynamic centralized
   control of a network.

   PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing [RFC8664] specifies extensions to
   the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful
   PCE to compute and initiate Traffic Engineering (TE) paths, as well
   as a PCC to request a path subject to certain constraint(s) and
   optimization criteria in SR networks.

   PCEP Extensions for Establishing Relationships Between Sets of LSPs
   [RFC8697] introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs
   which can then be used to define associations between a set of LSPs
   and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or
   behaviors) and is equally applicable to stateful PCE (active and
   passive modes) and stateless PCE.

   Segment Routing Policy for Traffic Engineering [RFC9256] details the
   concepts of SR Policy and approaches to steering traffic into an SR
   Policy.

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association             March 2023


   This document extends [RFC8664] to fully support the SR Policy
   construct.  SR Policy is modeled in PCEP as an Association of one or
   more SR Candidate Paths.  By associating multiple SR Candidate Paths,
   a PCE becomes aware of the hierarchical structure of an SR Policy.
   Thus the PCE can take computation and control decisions about the
   Candidate Paths, with the additional knowledge that these Candidate
   Paths belong to the same SR Policy.  This is accomplished via the use
   of the PCEP Association object with a new association type.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   Endpoint:  The IPv4 or IPv6 endpoint address of the SR Policy in
      question, as described in [RFC9256].

   Association Parameters:  As described in [RFC8697], the combination
      of the mandatory fields Association Type, Association ID and
      Association Source in the ASSOCIATION object uniquely identify the
      association group.  If the optional TLVs - Global Association
      Source or Extended Association ID are included, then they MUST be
      included in combination with mandatory fields to uniquely identify
      the association group.

   Association Information:  As described in [RFC8697], the ASSOCIATION
      object could also include other TLVs based on the association
      types, that provides non-key information.

   SRPA:  SR Policy Association.  PCEP ASSOCATION that describes the SR
      Policy.  Can refer to the PCEP object or to the group of LSPs that
      belong to the Association.  This should be clear from the context.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   PCEP Tunnel:  The entity identified by the PLSP-ID, as per
      [I-D.koldychev-pce-operational].

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association             March 2023


3.  Motivation

   The SR Policy Association and its TLVs, defined in this document,
   allow PCEP speakers to exchange additional information about SR
   Policy Candidate Paths and their container SR Policy.

3.1.  Group Candidate Paths belonging to the same SR Policy

   Since each SR Policy Candidate Path appears as a different Tunnel
   (identified via a PLSP-ID) in PCEP, it is useful to group together
   all the SR Policy Candidate Paths that belong to the same SR Policy.
   Furthermore, it is useful for the PCE to have knowledge of the SR
   Policy related information such as color, endpoint, protocol origin,
   discriminator, and preference.

3.2.  Instantiation of SR Policy Candidate Paths

   A PCE needs to instantiate one or more SR Policy Candidate Paths on
   the PCC, as specified in [RFC8281].  Each SR Policy Candidate Path is
   identified by the tuple <headend, color, endpoint, originator,
   discriminator, preference>.  This draft provides a mechanism to
   signal this information in PCEP.

3.3.  Avoid computing lower preference Candidate Paths

   When a PCE knows that a given set of SR Policy Candidate Paths all
   belong to the same SR Policy, then path computation MAY be done on
   only the highest preference Candidate Path(s).  Path computation for
   lower preference paths is not necessary if one or two higher
   preference paths are already computed.  Since computing their paths
   will not affect traffic steering, it MAY be postponed until the
   higher preference paths become invalid.

3.4.  Minimal signaling overhead

   When an SR Policy contains multiple SR Policy Candidate Paths
   computed by a PCE, such Candidate Paths can be created, updated and
   deleted independently of each other.  This is achieved by making each
   SR Policy Candidate Path correspond to a unique Tunnel (identified
   via PLSP-ID).  For example, if an SR Policy has 4 SR Policy Candidate
   Paths, then if the PCE wants to update one of those, only one set of
   PCUpd and PCRpt messages needs to be exchanged.

4.1.  Overview

   As per [RFC8697], LSPs are placed into an association group.  As per
   [I-D.koldychev-pce-operational], LSPs are contained in PCEP Tunnels
   and a PCEP Tunnel is contained in an Association if all of its LSPs
   are in that Association.  PCEP Tunnels naturally map to SR Policy
   Candidate Paths and PCEP Associations naturally map to SR Policies.

   The mapping between PCEP Associations and SR Policies is always one-
   to-one.  However, the mapping between PCEP Tunnels and SR Policy
   Candidate Paths may be either one-to-one, or many-to-one, see
   Section 4.2.

   Each SR Policy Candidate Path contains one or more Segment Lists.
   The subject of encoding multiple Segment Lists within an SR Policy
   Candidate Path is described in [I-D.ietf-pce-multipath].

   This document defines a new Association Type called "SR Policy
   Association" (SRPA), of value 6 based on the generic ASSOCIATION
   object.

   As per the processing rules specified in section 6.4 of [RFC8697], if
   a PCEP speaker does not support SRPA, it MUST return a PCErr message
   with Error-Type = 26 "Association Error", Error-Value = 1
   "Association-type is not supported".

   A given LSP MUST belong to at most one SRPA, since an SR Policy
   Candidate Path cannot belong to multiple SR Policies.  If a PCEP
   speaker receives a PCEP message requesting to join more than one SRPA
   for the same LSP, then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message
   with Error-Type = 26 "Association Error", Error-Value = 7 "Cannot
   join the association group".

   An SRPA carries three pieces of information: SR Policy Identifiers,
   SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers, and SR Policy Candidate Path
   Attributes.

4.1.1.  SR Policy Identifiers

   SR Policy Identifiers uniquely identify the SR Policy within the
   context of the headend.  SR Policy Identifiers MUST be the same for
   all SR Policy Candidate Paths in the same SRPA.  SR Policy
   Identifiers MUST NOT change for a given SR Policy Candidate Path
   during its lifetime.  SR Policy Identifiers MUST be different for
   different SRPAGs.  SR Policy Identifiers consist of:

   *  Headend router where the SR Policy originates.

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association             March 2023


   *  Color of SR Policy.

   *  Endpoint of SR Policy.

4.1.2.  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers

   SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers uniquely identify the SR Policy
   Candidate Path within the context of an SR Policy.  SR Policy
   Candidate Path Identifiers MUST NOT change for a given LSP during its
   lifetime.  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers MUST be different for
   different LSPs within the same SRPA.  When these rules are not
   satisfied, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 26
   "Association Error", Error Value = TBD8 "SR Policy Candidate Path
   Identifiers Mismatch".  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers consist
   of:

   *  Protocol Origin.

   *  Originator.

   *  Discriminator.

4.1.3.  SR Policy Candidate Path Attributes

   SR Policy Candidate Path Attributes carry non-key information about
   the Candidate Path and MAY change during the lifetime of the LSP.  SR
   Policy Candidate Path Attributes consist of:

   *  Preference.

   *  Optionally, the SR Policy Candidate Path name.

   *  Optionally, the SR Policy name.

4.2.  Multiple Optimization Objectives and Constraints

   In certain scenarios, it is desired for each SR Policy Candidate Path
   to contain multiple sub-Candidate Paths, each of which has a
   different optimization objective and constraints.  Traffic is then
   sent ECMP or UCMP among these sub-Candidate Paths.

   This is represented in PCEP by a many-to-one mapping between PCEP
   Tunnels and SR Policy Candidate Paths.  This means that multiple PCEP
   Tunnels are allocated for each SR Policy Candidate Path.  Each PCEP
   Tunnel has its own optimization objective and constraints.  When a
   single SR Policy Candidate Path contains multiple PCEP Tunnels, each
   of these PCEP Tunnels MUST have identical values of Candidate Path
   Identifiers, as encoded in SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID TLV, see Section 5.2.2.

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association             March 2023


5.  SR Policy Association

   Two ASSOCIATION object types for IPv4 and IPv6 are defined in
   [RFC8697].  The ASSOCIATION object includes "Association Type"
   indicating the type of the association group.  This document adds a
   new Association Type (6) "SR Policy Association".  This Association
   Type is dynamic in nature, thus operator-configured Association Range
   MUST NOT be set for this Association type and MUST be ignored.

5.1.  Association Parameters

   As per [RFC9256], an SR Policy is identified through the tuple
   <headend, color, endpoint>. the headend is encoded as the Association
   Source in the ASSOCIATION object and the color and endpoint are
   encoded as part of Extended Association ID TLV.

   The Association Parameters (see Section 2) consist of:

   *  Association Type: set to 6 "SR Policy Association".

   *  Association Source (IPv4/IPv6): set to the headend IP address.

   *  Association ID (16-bit): set to "1".

   *  Extended Association ID TLV: encodes the Color and Endpoint of the
      SR Policy.

   The Association Source MUST be set to the headend value of the SR
   Policy, as defined in [RFC9256] Section 2.1.  If the PCC receives a
   PCInit message for a non-existent SR Policy, where the Association
   Source is set not to the headend value but to some globally unique IP
   address that the PCC owns, then the PCC SHOULD accept the PCInit
   message and create the SR Policy Association with the Association
   Source that was sent in the PCInit message.

   The 16-bit Association ID field in the ASSOCIATION object MUST be set
   to the value of "1".

   The Extended Association ID TLV MUST be included and it MUST be in
   the following format:

                Figure 1: Extended Association ID TLV format

   Type: Extended Association ID TLV, type = 31.

   Length: Either 8 or 20, depending on whether IPv4 or IPv6 address is
   encoded in the Endpoint.

   Color: SR Policy color value.

   Endpoint: can be either IPv4 or IPv6, depending on whether the policy
   endpoint is IPv4 or IPv6.  This value MAY be different from the one
   contained in the END-POINTS object, or in the LSP IDENTIFIERS TLV of
   the LSP object.  This value is part of the tuple <color, endpoint>
   that identifies the SR Policy on a given headend.

   If the PCEP speaker receives an SRPA object whose Association
   Parameters do not follow the above specification, then the PCEP
   speaker MUST send PCErr message with Error-Type = 26 "Association
   Error", Error-Value = TBD7 "SR Policy Identifiers Mismatch".

   The purpose of choosing the Association Parameters in this way is to
   guarantee that there is no possibility of a race condition when
   multiple PCEP speakers want to create the same SR Policy at the same
   time.  By adhering to this format, all PCEP speakers come up with the
   same Association Parameters independently of each other.  Thus, there
   is no chance that different PCEP speakers will come up with different
   Association Parameters for the same SR Policy.

5.2.  Association Information

   The SRPA object contains the following TLVs:

   *  SRPOLICY-POL-NAME TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy Name string.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID TLV: (mandatory) encodes SR Policy Candidate
      Path Identifiers.

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association             March 2023


   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-NAME TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy Candidate
      Path string name.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-PREFERENCE TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy
      Candidate Path preference value.

   Of these new TLVs, SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID TLV is mandatory.  When a
   mandatory TLV is missing from the SRPA object, the PCE MUST send a
   PCErr message with Error-Type = 6 "Mandatory Object Missing", Error-
   Value = TBD6 "Missing Mandatory TLV".

5.2.1.  SR Policy Name TLV

   The SRPOLICY-POL-NAME TLV is an optional TLV for the SRPA object.  At
   most one SRPOLICY-POL-NAME TLV SHOULD be encoded by the sender and
   only the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be
   ignored.

6.  Generic Mechanisms

   This section describes various mechanisms that are standardized for
   SR Policies in [RFC9256], but are equally applicable to other tunnel
   types, such as RSVP-TE tunnels.  Hence this section does not make use
   of the SRPA.

6.1.  Computation Priority TLV

   The COMPUTATION-PRIORITY TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.
   It is used to signal the numerical computation priority, as specified
   in Section 2.12 of [RFC9256].  If the TLV is absent from the LSP
   object, a default Priority value of 128 is used.

   Type: TBD1 for "COMPUTATION-PRIORITY" TLV.

   Length: 4.

   Priority: Numerical priority with which this LSP is to be recomputed
   by the PCE upon topology change.

6.2.  Explicit Null Label Policy (ENLP) TLV

   The ENLP TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.  It is used to
   implement the "Explicit Null Label Policy", as specified in
   Section 2.4.5 of [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].

       0                   1                   2                   3

   ENLP (Explicit NULL Label Policy): same values as in Section 2.4.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].

6.3.  Invalidation TLV

   The INVALIDATION TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.  It is
   used to control traffic streering into the LSP during the time when
   the LSP is operationally down/invalid.  In the context of SR Policy,
   this TLV facilitates the "Drop upon invalid" behavior, specified in
   Section 8.2 of [RFC9256].  Normally, if the LSP is down/invalid then
   traffic that is originally destined for that LSP is steered somewhere
   else, such as via IGP or via another LSP.  The "Drop upon invalid"
   behavior specifies that such traffic MUST NOT be re-routed and has to
   be dropped at the head-end.  While in the "Drop upon invalid" state,
   the LSP operational state is "UP", as indicated by the O-flag in the
   LSP object.  However the ERO object is empty, indicating that traffic
   is being dropped.

   In addition to the above, this TLV can also be used by the PCC to
   report to the PCE various reasons for LSP being invalidated.
   Invalidation reasons are represented by a set of flags.

                               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   *  G: Generic - does not fit into any other categories below.

   *  P: Path computation failure - no path was computed for the LSP.

   *  F: First-hop resolution failure - head-end first hop resolution
      has failed.

   *  V: Verification failure - OAM/PM/BFD path verification has
      indicated a breakage.

                   Figure 9: The INVALIDATION TLV format

   Type: TBD3 for "INVALIDATION" TLV.

   Length: 4.

   Inval Reason: contains "Invalidation Reasons Flags" which encode the
   reason(s) why the LSP is currently invalidated.  This field can be
   set to non-zero values only by the PCC, it MUST be set to 0 by the
   PCE and ignored by the PCC.

   Drop Upon: contains "Invalidation Reasons Flags" for conditions that
   MUST cause the LSP to drop traffic.  This field can be set to non-
   zero values by both PCC and PCE.  When the G-flag is set, this
   indicates that the LSP is to go into Drop upon invalid state for any
   reason.  I.e., when the PCE does not wish to distinguish any reason
   for LSP invalidation and just simply wants it to always "Drop upon
   invalid" for any reason.  Note that when the G-flag is set, the
   values of the other flags are irrelevant.

6.4.  Specified-BSID-only

   Specified-BSID-only functionality is defined in Section 6.2.3 of
   [RFC9256].  When specified-BSID-only is enabled for a particular
   binding SID, it means that the given binding SID is required to be
   allocated and programmed for the LSP to be operationally up.  If the
   binding SID cannot be allocated or programmed for some reason, then
   the LSP must stay down.

   To signal specified-BSID-only, a new bit: S (Specified-BSID-only) is
   allocated in the "TE-PATH-BINDING TLV Flag field" of the TE-PATH-
   BINDING TLV.  When this bit is set for a particular BSID, it means
   that the BSID follows the Specified-BSID-only behavior.  It is
   possible to have a mix of BSIDs for the same LSP: some with S=1 and
   some with S=0.

7.  Use of SR-RRO and SRv6-RRO objects

   [RFC8231] defines a PCRpt message which contains <intended-path>
   known as the ERO object and <actual-path> known as the RRO object.
   [RFC8664] defines SR-ERO and SR-RRO sub-objects for SR-TE LSPs.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] further defines SRv6-ERO and
   SRv6-RRO sub-objects for SRv6-TE paths.

   In practice RRO data is the result of signalling via a protocol such
   as RSVP-TE, which allows collection of per-hop information along the
   path.  The ERO and RRO values may be different as the path encoded in
   the ERO may differ than the RRO such as during protection conditions



Koldychev, et al.       Expires 6 September 2023               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association             March 2023


   or if the ERO contains loose hops which are expanded upon.  As
   Segment Routing LSP does not perform any signalling, the values of an
   SR-ERO/SRv6-ERO and SR-RRO/SRv6-RRO (respectively) are in practice
   the same, therefore some implementations have omitted the RRO when
   reporting a SR-TE LSP while others continue to send both ERO and RRO
   values.

   The following applies to SR-TE only.  If both ERO and RRO are present
   for the same LSP, it SHOULD be interpreted as the RRO being the
   actual path the LSP is taking but MAY interpret only the ERO as the
   actual path.  In the absence of RRO a PCE MUST interpret the ERO as
   the actual path for the LSP.  Until SR-TE introduces some form of
   signaling similar to RSVP-TE, the use of RRO is discouraged for SR-TE
   LSPs.

8.  IANA Considerations

9.  Implementation Status

   [Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
   well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

10.  Security Considerations

   This document defines one new type for association, which do not add
   any new security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], [RFC8664], [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] and
   [RFC8697] in itself.

   The information carried in the SRPA object, as per this document is
   related to SR Policy.  It often reflects information that can also be
   derived from the SR Database, but association provides a much easier
   grouping of related LSPs and messages.  The SRPA could provide an
   adversary with the opportunity to eavesdrop on the relationship
   between the LSPs.  Thus securing the PCEP session using Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the recommendations and best
   current practices in [RFC7525], is RECOMMENDED.
